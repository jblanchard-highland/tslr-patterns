We help our student members compare schools, weigh the cost against the education, and find scholarships, grants & other free sources of college funding. This is all before we ever suggest you borrow money. While you may find these tools in other places, Thrivent aggregates them into one place for you. You can create a plan backed by our research and your choices, combined into a clear map of how to navigate choosing, planning and paying for college. And if the need remains to get a loan to close the last part of â€¨the gap, we will help you then as well." class="dark-contrast no-gradiant" image="/images/tools-resources.jpg"}}
